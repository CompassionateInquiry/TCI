Love over hate. Compassion over division.

Someone harms you, mentally or physically. Someone acts in a selfish way. Someone gives in to temptation. Someone does a bad thing.

There are 2 options that lead them to doing the bad thing:

Nature:
Genetic predisposition. A psychopath is the most obvious example. When a psychopath does something horrible, you can ask yourself: Did they choose this? No... they were screwed over by genetics. Thus, can you really blame them? I show compassion.

Nurture:
How our environment shapes us. Take someone racist, for example. They weren’t born like this. They were taught. Maybe it’s their parents. Maybe it’s their neighborhood, where they are constantly being bullied by people of color (because the people of color were bullied by "whites" or any other setup), or maybe their parents were, teaching their kids to be racists as well.

Anyhow, the hardened racist you see in front of you—the one who will gladly hurt someone opposed to him—he was a little kid once. A little boy, trying to make sense of this world. He didn’t choose to become this way. His environment made him so. Thus, can you really blame him? I show compassion.

I am not trying to excuse the actions of psychopaths or violent racists in this world. Not at all. I am saying that by dehumanizing them as “evil,” you are only pushing them further into their spiral, be it isolation or violent ideologies.

The only way out of the circle of hate and division is to show love and compassion.

No one will change their mind if you tell them they don’t deserve to walk on this earth. And you might be quite the hypocrite for saying so—because they think the exact same thing about other people. You are no better than them when you think like this.

However.
If you are attacked,
Mentally or physically,
Defend yourself.
Even if you have compassion for them.

I posted this on a forum. Here is the conversation that followed.


*Commenter’s Response:*

This is a nice read. I agree with everything you wrote.
But I still think some people deserve only to be put into gas chambers regardless of them being made the way they are by parents or surroundings, or if they are choosing violence or toxic behavior with full awareness of their actions.

I sometimes think of dogs, which have similar situations. An aggressive dog wasn’t born like that but had bad relationships with humans.

But the difference between dogs and humans is that a dog can’t become aware of its actions or seek help.

Humans can. So if a human—capable of insight and abstract thinking—is acting pathologically and doesn’t seek help, then they deserve punishment and everything bad that comes their way.

Just my opinion.

**My Response:**

“However,

Just don’t dehumanize them. Don’t compare them to dogs.

I posted something else—it’s on [[Generational trauma]]

While it isn’t centered around the part you’re talking about, there are a few lines about it:

> “To escape from these beliefs takes much time and great energy. Therefore, you can’t blame anybody if they don’t escape from what they were taught.”


You realize how hard it is to go against what you were taught? What your mind thinks automatically? To question it?

It is no easy task.

I show compassion.

**Commenter’s Reply:**

True, but I’ve been attacked so badly by people of this sort that I would never forgive them or try to explain their behavior. No compassion whatsoever.

What they did to me is very similar to what may have been done to them. So they are the ones who continued the cycle—they spread toxicity and pain instead of stopping it.

I know that changing behavior is hard and unnatural for someone who’s lived that way forever.

But look at a DUI case. We don’t care if the driver had alcoholic parents. If someone drives drunk and puts others at risk, they’re punished.

So even if someone grew up with trauma, if they harm society, they deserve to be treated like pests.

Hitler had a good idea—he just focused on the wrong group of people (that’s a half-serious joke).

**My Response:**

 You realize you are judging a part of yourself, right?

You realize that the people behaving like “pests” are operating under the same belief as you?

That some people are “pests”?

But they’re not pests. They’re human. Just like you.

You might not agree with their morals, actions, or thinking. Maybe everything about them disgusts you.

But they are still human.

I haven’t lived your life. I don’t know what this stems from.

But using hate to solve hate is ineffective.

Again,
I’m not saying what people do is right.
I’m not saying they don’t deserve punishment.

But simplifying it is a fast track to dehumanization.

“They are the bad ones. They are the reason that...”

That’s how genocide starts.

Which is exactly what happened with Hitler.

The path to hell is paved with good intentions.

**Commenter’s Final Reply:**

I agree. It’s a bad fix.

We as people should hold each other’s hands and look out for one another—like a good team.

In the end, we’re all on the same planet. But some people don’t act like it. They’re as far from compassion as I am from Jupiter.

They choose violence and selfishness. That’s been my experience.

And why should I show compassion when they never did that for me?

I didn’t used to feel this way. But after certain people came into my life, it changed me.

**My Final Response**:

 >“And why should I have compassion and understanding when they aren’t doing that for me?”

Because you can teach them to.

Some people have been shown nothing but hate and darkness.

If they’re that hard on others, imagine how hard some of them are on themselves.

So your solution to their hate and judgment… is to show hate and judgment?

Don’t you think they’ve had enough of that already?

> “You see I didn’t have that attitude toward anyone some time ago...”


You know what it takes to keep choosing kindness, even after being betrayed?

That takes courage.

Some call it weakness.

I see it as the ultimate show of strength.

Believing in a better world, even when the world isn’t there yet.

I refuse to lay down.
To let the cynics win.
To let the darkness overtake the world.

I know there’s a way for us to live in harmony.

I will die for that belief.
For that world I know is possible.

**A case study in compassion**

If you really read what the commenter is saying, you’ll notice something important.

He starts with dehumanization. Calling people pests. Saying (even if half-jokingly) that Hitler was kind of right, his genocide was just directed at the wrong half of society.

He focuses on justice through revenge, not healing. He compares people to aggressive dogs. He says some deserve to be gassed.

But as I continue to show compassion, something begins to shift.

His true motive reveals itself: he was hurt. He was betrayed. He didn’t always feel this way.

And then, out of nowhere, he says: “We as people should hold each other's hands and look out for one another, like a good team.”

That sentence comes from a different place than where he started.

That doesn’t mean he’s transformed. Healing takes time. But it cracked the armor. It showed that beneath the anger, the vengeance, the dehumanization, there’s a wounded human being.

This is exactly the point I’ve been trying to make:

People don’t hurt others because they want to. They do it because they are hurt.
